Thank you for playing against tomsup!
Here we will make you play against simulated agents in simple decision-making games.

We ask you for some basic demographic information. Apart from that, only performance in the game is collected.
If you at any time wish to do so, you are free to stop the experiment and ask for any generated data to be deleted.
If you have read the above and wish to proceed, press ENTER."""

You will now play a game of competitive matching pennies.

You will see the two hands of your opponent, one on the left, the other on the right.
One of the hands hides a penny. Your goal is to figure out which of the two hands contain the penny.
If you guess the correct hand, you get a point and your opponent loses a point.
If you guess incorrectly, you lose a point and your opponent gains a point.
The game will last for {n_trials} trials.

By pressing the "right arrow" on your keyboard, you guess "right".
By pressing the "left arrow" on your keyboard, you guess "left".
After guessing, press ENTER to continue.
To quit the game, press ESCAPE.
When you have read and understood the above, press ENTER to continue."""
