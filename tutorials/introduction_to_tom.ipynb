(2017)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005833), which is the model used by the ToM agents in the tomsup package. The guide will first give a conceptual overview of the model and its parameters, and will then go through the model in detail.\n","\n","---\n","## Conceptual overview\n","The ToM model used here is an attempt at approximating the theory of mind processes in humans. The simplest kind of ToM agent - the 0-ToM - assumes that it's opponent chooses randomly with a specific probability. It then employs a variational bayes kalman filter to estimate that choice probability based on the opponent's behavior, and makes the choice that will give it the most value, given the opponent's choice probability. In this sense, the 0-TOM does not attribute any intentionality or adaptivity to the opponent, but treats the opponent's choices as randomly generated phenomena. Within the context of this module, this would correspond to assuming that the opponent is a random bias agent.\n","\n","The more advanced 1-ToM, in turn, assumes that its opponent is a 0-ToM trying to predict the actions of the 1-ToM in the manner described above. The 1-TOM takes its opponent's perspective by simulating a 0-ToM model given the same inputs as the opponent. Based on this simulation of its opponent, and on an estimation of the opponent's model parameters, 1-ToM finally estimates the opponent's choice probability, and makes its own choice accordingly. An even more sophisticated 2-TOM agent, then, assumes its opponent to either be a 1-ToM or a 0-ToM. This means that, in order to predict it's opponent's move, 2-TOM must not only estimate the opponent's model parameters, but also estimate which model the opponent is using; that is, whether the opponent is a 0-TOM or a 1-TOM. 2-TOM does this on a turn by turn basis, by comparing the estimated choice probabilities to te opponent's actual behavior.\n","\n","In general, then, the k-TOM agent with k>0 estimates beliefs and model parameter values for k simulated opponents with levels between 0 and k-1. Based on these belief and parameter estimates it determines a different choice probability for each possible opponent type. It is the average of these choice probabilities, weighted by the estimated probability that the opponent is of the given type, which is used as the final estimate of the opponent's choice probability. Importantly, because k-TOM must simulate an opponent who is also simulating its own opponent, and where this simulated opponent may also have its own simulation and so on, k-TOM agents with higher levels perform many layers of recursive estimation, which means they become computationally demanding.\n","\n","k-TOM has the following model parameters: its sophistication level k, its volatility $\\sigma$, its behavioral temperature $\\beta$, its bias b and its dilution d. The sophistication level is described above. The volatility denotes how much k-TOM expects its opponent's parameters to drift, putting a lower bound on the uncertainty of its parameters estimates. The behavioral temperature decides to which degree, given an estimated choice proability for the opponent, k-TOM will randomize its behavior. The bias simply denotes an a priori preference for choosing one option or the other. And the dilution parameter decides to which degree k-TOM reduces its certainties in its estimations of the opponent's sophistication level, which allows it to re-estimate the level of an opponent who switches strategy during the game. \n","\n","The sophistication level can be any whole non-negative number, although sophistication levels above 5 are usually too computationally demanding to be practical. The volatility is inputted on a log scale, with lower numbers meaning less assumed volatility of opponent parameters. As default it is set to -2. The behavioral temperature is also inputted on a log scale, with lower numbers meaning less randomized behavior. It is as default set to -1. \n","Bias can be any positive or negative number, with negative numbers indicating a preference for option 0, while positive numbers indicate a preference for option 1. dilution can be any number between 0 and 1, where 0 means no forgetting, and 1 means complete resetting of estimated probabilites of opponent levels every turn. Note that while both bias and dilution have no direct effect on k-TOM's behavior if set to 0, it still estimates them for the opponent. If they are set to \"None\", they will not be estimated for the opponent. As default, bias is set to 0, because it is necessary for k-TOM to predict the behavior of random bias opponents, and dilution is set to \"None\".\n","\n","k-TOM uses a variational Bayes Laplace approximation (for more on this, see chapter 5 in [this book](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/advstatcomp/laplace-approximation.html)) to estimate opponent parameter values. This means that every parameter estimate is represented with a mean and a variance. The estimate of the opponent's choice probability is represented with a mean, produced by simulating the opponent's choice alorithm using the means of the estimated parameters, and a variance, which is a composite of the variances of all parameter estimates. The estimated probability of the opponent having a certain sophistication level is represented with a simple probability.\n"," In the end of this tutorial, after the practical examples for the k-TOM agent, there is a more thorough explanation of the mathematics behind the k-TOM model. But now we will move the in-code implementation of the k-TOM agent.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["---\n","# Application and code\n","\n","In the following, we will show how to program a k-TOM agent, how to set its model parameters, how to make it compete, and how to extract its estimates at a given time.\n","\n","First we create some different TOM agents. We set their volatilities behavioral temperatures. Notice that if bias or dilution is set to 0, they do not affect the k-TOM's own behavior, but k-TOM still estimates them for its opponent. If they are set to \"None\", they are also not estimated for the opponent. \n","\n","We set all k-TOM agents to save their history, which will later allows us to extract their estimates on any given round."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#This is only relevant if tomsup was installed from the github folder\n","#Move up to the correct folder\n","import os\n","os.chdir('..')\n","#And import the tomsup library\n","import tomsup as ts\n","\n","#Get the competitive penny game payoff matrix\n","penny = ts.PayoffMatrix(\"penny_competitive\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Create a 0-TOM agent with volatility -2, temperature -1, and no bias or dilution.\n","sir_TOM0 = ts.TOM(level = 0, volatility= -2,  b_temp= -1, bias = None, dilution = None, save_history = True)\n","\n","#Create a 1-TOM agent with a higher volatility -2, temperature -1, no bias or dilution, but which estimates the bias of its opponent.\n","sir_TOM1 = ts.TOM(level = 1, volatility= 1,  b_temp= -1, bias = 0, dilution = None, save_history = True)\n","\n","#Create a 2-TOM agent with default values: volatility -2, temperature -1, no bias or dilution, but which estimates the bias of its opponent.\n","sir_TOM2 = ts.TOM(level = 2, volatility= -2,  b_temp= -1, bias = 0, dilution = None, save_history = True)\n","\n","#Create a 2-TOM agent with volatility -2, a low temperature -4, a bias of 0.5 and a dilution of 0.4.\n","sir_TOM2_d = ts.TOM(level = 2, volatility= -2,  b_temp= -4, bias = 0.5, dilution = 0.4, save_history = True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"{'volatility': -2, 'b_temp': -1}\n{'volatility': -2, 'b_temp': -1, 'bias': 0}\n{'volatility': -2, 'b_temp': -4, 'dilution': 0.4, 'bias': 0.5}\n"}],"source":["#We can extract the given parameter values of the agents\n","print(sir_TOM0.get_parameters())\n","print(sir_TOM2.get_parameters())\n","print(sir_TOM2_d.get_parameters())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"1"},"execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["#Make the 0-TOM agent compete a number of rounds while saving its history.

Using the estimated parameter values, $k$-ToM performs a recursive simulation of its opponent to calculate a mean choice probability estimate $\\mu$, which it compares to choice probability estimates using incremented parameter estimates in order to calculate the new gradient $W$. Now the choice probability for each possible opponent level $\\kappa$, $P^{op, \\kappa }$, can be calculated and averaged to a single choice probability estimate $P^{op}$.
