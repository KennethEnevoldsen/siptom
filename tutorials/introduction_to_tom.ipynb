(2017)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005833), which include practical example. The guide will use the matching pennies game as an example but assume \n\nThis guide will start of by a brief introduction of concept, which experienced readers are welcome to skip and followingly present practical examples of the model.\n\n---\n## The concepts behind\nThis notebook will introduce the concept behind the computational ToM by Devaine et al. (2017). The computational ToM is a model which seeks to approximate the model human uses a game theory context.\n\n\n\n It uses variational Bayes Laplace approximation to estimate opponent parameter values, sicne it is a way of approximating Bayes-optimal updating, while being computationally feasible enough so that it is a realistic model of the Bayesian brain, as opposed to traditional sampling methods (Friston et al., 2006a; Daunizeau, 2017b).\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"from IPython.display import Image # for loading in images\nImage(\"img/picture.png\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"## The formulas and kinda practical examples\nWe will first take a look at the simplest theory of mind with a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"\n\n\nWe can present this using the following graphical model:\n\n<img src=\"img/gm_tom_0.png\" alt=\"Graphical Models of 0-ToM\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n\nWhere shaded (grey) constitute observed variables while non-shaded (white) is unobserved. squares and circles constitute discrete and continous varaibles respectively.
